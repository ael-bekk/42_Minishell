## About

- Minishell is a project at school 42.

- The objective of this project is to create a simple shell to learn a lot about processes and file descriptors.

- The existence of shells is linked to the very existence of IT. At the time, all coders agreed that communicating with a computer using aligned 1/0 switches was seriously irritating. It was only logical that they came up with the idea to communicate with
a computer using interactive lines of commands in a language somewhat close to english.
With Minishell, youâ€™ll be able to travel through time and come back to problems people faced when Windows didnâ€™t exist.
